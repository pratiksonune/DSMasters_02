        "In a random forest regressor, a set of decision trees are trained using bootstrap samples of the training data, where each tree is grown using a different subset of the features.

        "Random forest regression is often used in scenarios where there are complex nonlinear relationships between the input features and the target variable. It is a popular algorithm in the field of machine learning due to its ease of use, good performance, and ability to handle large datasets with high-dimensional feature spaces."

        "- Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging): Random Forest Regressor is built by aggregating multiple decision trees, each of which is trained on a random subset of the training data. This technique is known as bootstrap aggregation or bagging. By training each tree on a different subset of the data, random forest is able to reduce the variance of the model and thus the risk of overfitting.\n",

        "- Random Feature Selection: In addition to using different subsets of the training data for each tree, random forest also uses a random subset of features for each split in the decision tree. By randomly selecting features at each split, the algorithm is able to reduce the correlation between the trees and thus the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Estimation: Another technique that helps reduce overfitting in random forest is OOB error estimation. Since each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the data, some of the data points will be left out of the training process for each tree. These left-out data points are called out-of-bag samples, and they can be used to estimate the performance of the model on unseen data. This provides a way to evaluate the model's performance without the need for a separate validation set."

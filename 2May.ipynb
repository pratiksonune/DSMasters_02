An anomaly is an observation that differs significantly from the majority of the data points in the dataset, either in terms of its statistical properties or its domain-specific characteristics.\n",

        "- The purpose of anomaly detection is to flag or identify data points that are outside of the norm or expected range of values. Anomaly detection is widely used in a variety of applications, including fraud detection, intrusion detection, network monitoring, system health monitoring, and predictive maintenance.\n",

        "In fraud detection, for example, anomaly detection can be used to identify unusual patterns of activity in financial transactions that could indicate fraudulent behavior. In intrusion detection, anomaly detection can help identify unusual network traffic that may be a sign of a cyber attack. In predictive maintenance, anomaly detection can help identify potential equipment failures before they occur, allowing for preventative maintenance to be performed."

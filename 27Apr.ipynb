        "1. K-means clustering: In this algorithm, the data points are divided into k clusters, where k is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid, and then recalculates the centroid of each cluster based on the mean of the data points in that cluster. This process is repeated until convergence. K-means assumes that the clusters are spherical, equally sized, and have a similar variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Hierarchical clustering: This algorithm creates a tree-like structure of nested clusters, where each node represents a cluster. There are two main types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then merges the closest clusters until there is only one cluster. Divisive clustering starts with all the data points in one cluster and then splits the cluster until there is one cluster for each data point. Hierarchical clustering does not require the user to specify the number of clusters in advance.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Spectral clustering: This algorithm uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data's similarity matrix to cluster the data. It assumes that the data points are embedded in a low-dimensional space, and that the clusters correspond to the connected components of a graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Model-based clustering: This algorithm assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of probability distributions, and it uses statistical methods to estimate the parameters of these distributions. It then assigns each data point to the most likely cluster based on these estimates."

The optimal number of clusters is the one that maximizes the average silhouette score across all data points.\n",

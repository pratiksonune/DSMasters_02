        "The \"curse of dimensionality\" refers to the phenomenon where the performance of machine learning algorithms degrades as the number of features or dimensions in the data increases. As the number of dimensions increases, the amount of data required to generalize accurately grows exponentially, which can make it difficult to train accurate models.\n",

In high-dimensional feature spaces, it becomes increasingly likely that the model will find complex patterns and overfit the training data, especially if the number of training examples is limited. This is because, as the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the feature space grows exponentially, and the available training data becomes increasingly sparse. This can make it difficult for the model to accurately capture the underlying patterns in the data, and can lead to overfitting.\n",

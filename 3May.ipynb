        "Feature selection plays an important role in anomaly detection as it helps to identify the most relevant features that can be used to distinguish normal data from anomalous data. Anomaly detection is the process of identifying patterns in data that deviate from the expected or normal behavior. The goal of anomaly detection is to identify unusual data points that may represent outliers or anomalies, which could indicate potential fraud, errors, or security breaches in a system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature selection involves choosing a subset of relevant features that can be used to train an anomaly detection model. The selection of features can impact the accuracy and efficiency of the anomaly detection model. In some cases, using all available features may result in overfitting or noise, leading to poor performance. On the other hand, selecting too few features may result in a loss of important information and reduced accuracy.\n",

These techniques may include filter methods, wrapper methods, or embedded methods, depending on the specific application and dataset.

        "On the other hand, MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual house prices. It is a more appropriate metric for evaluating the accuracy of predictions and penalizes large errors more heavily than small errors, which is important in the context of predicting house prices accurately. Therefore, if your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, MSE is the most appropriate regression metric to use."

        "If your dataset contains a significant number of outliers, then the most appropriate regression metric to use with your SVM model would be the mean absolute error (MAE).\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason for this is that MAE is less sensitive to outliers than other regression metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE), which can be significantly affected by large errors. In contrast, MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, which gives equal weight to all errors regardless of their size.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the presence of outliers, it is important to use an evaluation metric that is robust to extreme values and provides a more accurate representation of the errors. Therefore, MAE is the most appropriate regression metric to use in this scenario, as it is less influenced by outliers and provides a more accurate measure of the model's performance."

        "Therefore, if there is no significant difference between the MSE and RMSE values, either metric can be chosen based on personal preference or based on the specific requirements of the problem. For example, if the target variable has a wide range of values, then RMSE may provide a better indication of the magnitude of the errors. Conversely, if the focus is on penalizing large errors more heavily, then MSE may be more appropriate."

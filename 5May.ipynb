        "In time series analysis, a seasonal component is a periodic variation in the data that repeats over a fixed period of time, such as a year, quarter, or month. A time-dependent seasonal component is a seasonal component whose amplitude or pattern changes over time. For example, the sales of a product might be higher in the summer than in the winter, but the difference in sales between the two seasons might be larger in some years than in others.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of reasons why a seasonal component might be time-dependent. One reason is that the underlying factors that drive the seasonal pattern can change over time. For example, the weather might become more extreme, leading to larger fluctuations in sales. Another reason is that the way that people respond to the seasonal pattern can change over time. For example, people might become more aware of the seasonal pattern and start to plan their purchases accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time-dependent seasonal components can make it more difficult to forecast time series data. This is because the forecaster needs to take into account the possibility that the seasonal pattern will change in the future. There are a number of methods that can be used to forecast time series data with time-dependent seasonal components. One common method is to use a seasonal ARIMA model. A seasonal ARIMA model is a statistical model that can be used to forecast time series data that has both trend and seasonal components.\n",
